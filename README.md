# Build DAPPS With Solidity Smart Contracts and Web3
DAPPS with Solidity, Ethereum and Smart Contracts - React APP

Lets setup our local Ethereum network working. For now, all you need to know is that a smart contract is a piece of code that lives on the blockchain. The blockchain is a public place where anyone can securely read and write data for a fee. Think of it sorta like AWS or Heroku, except no one actually owns it!
So in this case, we want people to ðŸ‘‹ at us. The bigger picture here is:

1. We're going to write a smart contract. That contract has all the logic around how the ðŸ‘‹ s are handled. This is like your server code.
2. Our smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain. This way, anyone in the world will be able to access and run our smart contract (if we give them permission to do so). So, pretty much like a server :).
3. We're going to build a client website that will let people easily interact with our smart contract on the blockchain.
Hardhat - For Local Ethereum network
1. We're going to be using a tool called Hardhat a lot. This will let us easily spin up a local Ethereum network and give us fake test ETH and fake test accounts to work with. Remember, it's just like a local server, except the "server" is the blockchain.
2. Quickly compile smart contracts and test them on our local blockchain.
First you'll need to get node/npm. If you don't have it, head over here.
I recommend you install at least node v15 or you may run into some issues!

## What to do?

* Build Contracts
* Run them on ethereum test network
* Deploy them to ethereum test network
* Connect to metamask wallet
* Deploy  Smart Contracts to Rinkbay testnet with Alchemy.
* Use the ABI file for application communications
